# commonvoice-languagelearning

The goal of the project is to help you practice listening comprehension.

It works by giving you random sentences in the language you're learning and
asking you to fill in the gaps. The sentences were submitted by contributors
to [https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/](Mozilla Common Voice) platform.

# TO-DO

- [ ] select sentences based on desired difficulty level
- [ ] add tokenizers for languages with no word separator, e.g. Chinese
- [ ] calculate score
- [ ] add a way to set up reminders (e-mail, chat?)
